# 🇫🇮 Finnish Learning Notebook

Welcome to my **Finnish Learning Notebook**! 📚✨
This Jupyter notebook collects some of what I've been studying while learning Finnish — it's still a work in progress — including vocabulary, grammar notes, proverbs, and a fun interactive game.

## 📺 Lessons Included

This notebook includes study notes and chapter summaries inspired by the wonderful YouTube channel:
**Finnish With Anna** → [https://www.youtube.com/@FinnishWithAnna](https://www.youtube.com/@FinnishWithAnna)

I structured the notebook into chapters that follow her lessons, making it easy to revise and track progress.

## 📖 Vocabulary & Proverbs

All vocabulary and proverbs come from a **Finnish–English dictionary** and additional Finnish proverb collections.
Each entry includes:

* Finnish word 🇫🇮 (or proverb ✨)
* English translation 🇬🇧

---

## 🎮 Interactive Vocabulary & Proverb Game

This notebook includes a **custom-made quiz game** to help practice vocabulary and proverbs in a fun and dynamic way.

### ✅ How the game works:

* First, the user chooses **how many rounds** they want to play.
* Each round contains **10 questions**.
* Questions can ask for either a **Finnish word/proverb** or an **English word/proverb**.
* If the user answers incorrectly:

  * The game reveals **three letters** of the correct answer.
  * If the user still answers incorrectly, the game gives it **6 extra attempts**.

    * After the first **3 extra attempts**, the game:

      * Provides a **multiple choice list (4 options)** of the possible answers

  * If the user answers incorrectly **7 times** the game continues to the next question.

### 🏆 Scoring System

* After each round, the game displays the **current score** along with a motivational message.
* At the end of the game, it prints a **final sentence** that reflects the player's performance.

## 🧩 Why I Built This Notebook

Learning Finnish can be challenging, but combining:

* structured lessons,
* vocabulary lists,
* cultural expressions,
* and interactive practice…

…makes the process much more fun and memorable. 💙🇫🇮

This notebook is my personal study companion — but it may also help anyone learning Finnish.
